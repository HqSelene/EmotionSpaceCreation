# EmotionSpaceCreation

The game ```CONTEND FOR ROOM``` is developed through Unity and designed for the project ```Emotion Space Self-Construction```. In this game, you can see a short animation of our main character Selene, who suddenly collapsed when walking on the street. You need to control the ghost of Selene to collect these objects that can be helpful when she feels blue and make her develop into a larger assemblage and 'contend for' the public space.

You can play the game here: [CONTEND FOR ROOM](https://hqselene.github.io/EmotionSpaceCreation/). An installation and a performance wearing this installation are related to this project, you can find a video of this performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM26rF-7J4s.
